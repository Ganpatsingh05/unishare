# Backend API URL (Required for full functionality)
# This is the base URL for the UniShare backend API service
# 
# IMPORTANT: The backend service is a restricted internal service and not
# publicly accessible for security reasons. 
#
# For Development:
# - If you're a team member, contact the internal dev team for access credentials
# - Backend service URL will be provided to authorized developers
# - Leave blank to run in frontend-only mode (limited functionality)
#
# For Production/Deployment:
# - Set this in your deployment platform's environment variables
# - Example: https://api.unishare.yourdomain.com
#
# Note: When not configured, the app will gracefully handle missing backend
# and show appropriate messages to users.
